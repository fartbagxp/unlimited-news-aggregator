=Project Status=
  
	Currently, we have completed iteration 5 â€“ the final iteration that we had planned for to include a commenting system.  This came as a surprise to us since we can now go back to use case 3 (saving articles into PDFs) that we did not complete in iteration 3.  NewsOnAGo news aggregator currently has more than 80% (5/6) of its use cases completed.  We will be preparing for the final transition presentation, as well as all the deliverables for it over the next two weeks.
